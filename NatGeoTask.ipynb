    "corpus = [\"It’s 5.15 a.m. on a Friday and I have another 15 minutes to go before my alarm sets off. I lay in company of quiet contemplation that entices me to stay snug in bed, but tenacity slowly coaxes me awake. It is my second day at Atmantan, a wellness retreat overlooking the Mulshi Lake near Pune. The sun is still shy outside and the November air stings my face as I stroll past mango trees and garden-surrounding accommodations leading to the Kriya Pavillion, where I sign up for my first morning activity: netra shuddhi, an Ayurvedic practice of cleansing the eyes by rapidly blinking into two tiny cups filled with water to the brim. Arguably, it is believed that the exercise helps improve vision, but for starters, it jolts me wide awake. The instructor advises me not to peek at my phone screen for the next half an hour. For a change, I manage to accomplish a micro digital detox, courtesy of no network with the exception of WiFi connectivity in my room and the reception area.Back home in Mumbai, fast-paced ways of the city leaves me with only a semblance of a schedule, let alone a well-balanced lifestyle. Atmantan serves as my antidote. I arrive on a pleasant afternoon after a four-hour drive from Mumbai. The last leg of the journey is bumpy, but I don’t pay heed to the road as the surrounding Sahyadri range juxtaposed with the endless Mulshi Lake distract me. The view follows me even past the property’s guarded gates, which I’m informed I can’t exit for the remainder of my retreat. Admittedly, it is my first time at a wellness resort and I’m unsure what lies ahead. I opt for the Atmantan Living programme, a package designed for beginners who “seek a new way of living in order to undo erroneous lifestyle choices and adopt a healthier and happier daily routine,” describes the official website. Having opened in 2016, the property is sprawled across 42 acres and seems as though it has been designed to become one with nature. The area boasts bursts of green spaces, 97 rooms including the spaciously private Rain Tree Villa, while a few more accommodations along with a chef’s garden and a reflexology walking area are still underway. “Every season has a different feel to it here,” Gopi Krishna, a Kerala native and the Resort Manager tells me whilst giving me a tour of the address. “Monsoon is my personal favourite.” I believe him, albeit the cold is just as delightful.  He also tells me that all the hot water is fully solar powered and the on-site herb and kitchen gardens are responsible for producing majority of the fresh produce. Fresh ghee from the gaushala is added in cooking and the milk is reserved for treatments only. Ingredients like pasta and cheese are procured from Pune after being imported from Italy. There are also plans to add an art gallery and invite local artists to put on a cultural show for guests. For me it is the snaking pathways, neatly manicured lawns, a butterfly garden that houses 35 species of the insect, a lily pond, a private garden adjoining my room, and a giant Buddha statue that adds to the place’s Zen factor. I learn that Vrindavan, near the entrance, doubles as an outdoor yoga spot and a helipad, and the on-site Ganesh temple hosts a morning aarti every day. I, however, divide most of my time between the wellness and the dining pavilions. After a healthy indulgence of gado gado salad, broccoli soup, and white sauce pasta, I meet with Dr. Shaddha Shetty for my initial round of wellness consultation. She quizzes me about my lifestyle and medical history, and after poring over the details, decides there is nothing that a good diet, a sound sleep, and a few supplements can’t fix. My spa appointments and food chart are customised accordingly. I also meet with Dr. Aneesh, a wellness administrator, who simplifies the retreat’s philosophy for me; their approach seeks inspiration from branches of naturopathy, Ayurveda, and modern science. I wrap my head around the concept, but underestimate the “healing crisis” that is about to knock me out. My days start unusually early and I keep busy for most part as I shuttle between yoga, dance, aqua fitness and the spa (all housed inside the wellness pavilion). But to my surprise it is the mostly plant-based diet that seems like the toughest nut to crack. A bite-sized portion of raw okra salad, “rasam soup”, and coconut and chickpea flour rotis with Kashmiri malai kofta make up my first post-consultation meal. Nonetheless, I’m famished at the end. When I request an extra portion of the main course, the server smiles sheepishly and reminds me that I’m only allowed to indulge in the soup and the salad as per doctor’s orders. I take what I can get and scoot to my room, where I demolish a packet of biscuits that I had packed for the road earlier. I sleep with no regrets, but make a pact with myself to try harder the next day. Fortunately, I persevere.\",\n",
    "\"The scent of pine trees mingle with fresh soil and the plummeting temperature is directly proportional to the fading sun. I’m in the Skyview Gondola—supposedly India’s highest at 65 metres of ground clearance—from where I watch tops of fir trees, people the size of sparrows, corn and barley fields, narrow hiking trails, village homes, and school grounds flicker past over a distance of 2.8 kilometres in the next 10 minutes. Thick forests surround formidable mountains straight ahead, while a glance at Patnitop—the cable car’s destination terminal at an altitude of 1,343 metres in the opposite direction—reveals a cluster of hillside boutique properties. It is easy to mistake the landscape for a European countryside if not for the looming Himalayas in the distance. A two-hour drive from Jammu Airport brings me to Skyview by Empyrean—a leisure accommodation-cum-adventure station in Jammu’s Sanget Valley. It is my maiden encounter with India’s northernmost Union Territory. What started out as a recreational initiative in 2019, eventually expanded to include 10 rooms over the years, drawing pilgrims attending the Vaishno Devi yatra from Katra, and locals on day-trips from nearby towns and even Delhi. The project, spread across 22 acres, had officially been granted permission to fell 25 trees, but the management prides itself on having executed the task without incurring any damage to nature, a company official informs me. Sustainability has always been at the core of their planning and the gondola cuts down road journey by 45-60 minutes, thereby encouraging green mobility in the region. An arduous first day ends with a sumptuous feast at Banana Leaf, the property’s main restaurant that serves Indian, Chinese, and Continental fare alongside valley views. I spend hours drawing up a list of local grub that I wish to devour during my visit, and nadru yakhni—a Kashmiri lotus stem preparation—features right on top. But I learn that the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir do not necessarily follow similar diets. Lotus stems aren’t widely consumed in the area and so, aren’t always readily available in the town’s market. Instead, I turn my attention to the most succulent rogan josh that more than makes up for the absence of the vegetarian dish. While a barbecue dinner at the al fresco Skyview Cafe is every bit inviting, the relentless September heat coupled with a local preparation of the ghee-bathed rajmash chawal at a roadside dhaba costs me my appetite. Needless to say, a hot bowl of tomato soup becomes my trusted choice of order for the remainder of the trip. I waste no time in retreating to my accommodation—a humble mountain-facing room—and retire for the night. I give the cycling trail and the tubing sledge a miss the following morning and instead try my hand at the on-site zipline that stretches 580 metres in length over nine levels across a neatly manicured slope. I’m warned that once I embark on the excursion, my only way out is zipping to the end, unless I wished to risk a mid-task rescue. It takes a few rounds of training sessions, some concentration, and impeccable hand-eye coordination to nail the feat for which I’m assigned a completion certificate at the finish line. The rest of the day is relatively laidback and involves long hours on winding roads that overlook deep gorges and tiny village settlements. In the neighbouring Kud, I meet the fourth-generation owner of the family-run Prem Sweets, a 1925-established shop, and sample the decadent patisa—a flaky sweet doused in ghee that is a distant cousin of the soan papdi. In Nathatop, 14 kilometres from Patnitop, I set out on a short hike to the summit, which showcases a blanket of deodar trees below and vanilla-scooped clouds above. Unfortunately, the site is marred by the troubles of overtourism. So, I soak in the vistas and move on to the hill station of Sanasar, named after twin lakes called Sana and Sar, where I snap up a seat by the lake front and gaze at the lone shikara doing the rounds from one end to another, before shifting my focus to the tulip field that is being readied for harvest on the other side. Come winter, I’m told that the waterbody is tucked under a veil of snow. My lunch venue is a meadow-side treat. The staff sets up a tent in the middle of a breezy open field, a little further from the lakes. Boxes of kathi rolls, masala-fried idli and chutneys, salad, and fresh fruits are carefully arranged on our makeshift table and I’m instantly nostalgic for childhood picnics. A sip of warm kahwa hits me like epiphany: life’s greatest gratifications often stem from the simplest moments.\",\n",
    "\"Arepas con queso are the breakout stars of Encanto, the Disney hit set in Colombia. It almost seems convincing when Julieta Madrigal channels her magical powers to heal the ill with the cheesy, savoury corn cake. After all, arepas are the backbone of Colombian gastronomy, the traditional dish adding a daily dose of enchantment to everyday meals across households in the country. Route to its Roots According to Latin American Post, experts believe that the native tribes that lived in the region now known as modern-day Colombia and Venezuela started cooking with corn around 3,000 years ago. Its evidence lies in uncovered, ancient cooking utensils used for the making of arepa, though it doesn’t explain why the same dish is prepared so differently in both nations. It is said that there are at least 55 types of arepas con queso in Colombia. There are at least 55 types of arepa in Colombia, and 42 in Venezuela, according to Carlos Gaviria, chef and teacher at Colombia’s La Sabana University. Some of the many varieties of Colombian arepas include: arepas de chócolo (known as cachapas in Venezuela) which are covered in cheese and folded in half; arepas santandereanas that call for small pieces of crackling pork to be introduced into the dough; the deep-fried, egg-filled arepas de huevo that is inspired from the Caribbean; and the thin, cheeseless arepas paisa, topped with a ricotta-resembling farmer’s cheese called quesillo. Venezuelan-style arepas are more similar to thicker, corn-based flatbreads such as Mexican gorditas and the Salvadorian pupusas, typically stuffed with fillings such as meat, beans, or seafood, while the Colombian version is quintessentially plain with cheese or just egg. In the case of Colombian arepas, milk is often added to the dough—made with a special type of cornmeal or corn flour called masarepa or arepa flour—considered the secret to airy, Colombian-style arepas. Table Manners Arepas can be eaten throughout the day and are considered an indispensable side dish in any household, though they’re typically devoured during breakfast with hot chocolate or coffee. Best Bet Colombitalia Arepas and Quero Arepa in Bolivar, and Estación Arepa Rellena and Arepas Factor Express in Bogota are local favourites. Medellin also has some great options, such as Los Chamos Arepas Venezolanas, Mi Arepa, and Arepas Rellenas.

    "\"Hoi An Heritage Haunt Bright, colourful lanterns are strung from timber-frame structures that flank both sides of the alleyways, and a canal zips through the town’s centre. Visiting Hoi An Ancient Town feels like partaking in the Festival of Lights, only on a daily basis. Before it became a tourist magnet in recent years, the quarter in Quang Nam province was once a popular trading port for Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and Dutch merchants dealing in silk, ceramics, and spices between the 15th and the 19th centuries. Today, the UNESCO World Heritage Site is a nod to a well-preserved mashup of cultures—local and foreign—which is evident in ornate Cantonese temples, Dutch and French colonial homes, wooden shop houses, and the 17th century-built Japanese Bridge (etched on notes of VND 20,000). Cash in on the opportunity to get custom-made ao dai—traditional Vietnamese apparel—from any of the local tailor shops in only 24 hours or hunker down on tiny red stools and sip on fresh brews by street-corner stalls, there is no wrong choice here. While daytime is charming, an evening stroll through the lanes is downright romantic. How To Make The Most Of Central Vietnam A fisherman (left) casts his net in the waters of Cam Thanh village near Hoi An; A seafood spread (right) at Golden Light Restaurant. Photos by: Pooja Naik Coracle Calls Fishermen by dawn and boatmen by noon, such is life for locals in Cam Thanh region, commonly known as Coconut Village. The site, situated merely six kilometres from Hoi An Ancient Town, is widely popular for their offering of the bamboo-basket boat ride. Navigate palm tree-dotted canals on eco-friendly coracles, whilst boatmen entertain by dancing to head-spinning tunes and casting fishing nets in the waters. If you want the complete adrenaline experience, request a dizzying twirl that feels like being caught in a whirlpool. Tipping at the end of the excursion is considered polite. Bold Bites Pho requires no introduction and is slurped by bowlfuls all over Vietnam, but Hoi An is home to regional delicacies such as the delicate, shrimp-stuffed white rose dumplings (banh bao banh vac); onion, turmeric, and coriander tossed chicken rice (com ga hoi an); and thinly sliced soy-simmered pork, herbs, and wide rice noodle mix called cao lau (pronounced gaow laow). Although lotus seed sweet soup infused with water chestnut or litchi (che vai hat sen) isn’t native to the place, it must not be missed. For a set seafood menu that includes specialties such as toasted crayfish bathed in butter and garlic, steamed squid, and sweet-and-sour shell broth, a reservation at Golden Light Restaurant on Hai Ba Trung street is recommended. Temple Touring My Son (pronounced mee saw, meaning “beautiful mountains”) Sanctuary is a portal to the region’s ancient history. A cluster of Hindu temple ruins from 4th and 13th centuries are scattered across the open, tree-lined landscape surrounded by Cat’s Tooth Mountain (Hon Quap). Interestingly, the UNESCO World Heritage Site is the erstwhile capital of the Champa Kingdom of the Cham people, whose spiritual origins were rooted in Hinduism. The windowless structures with a sole east-facing door are made of fired bricks held together with a mixture of resin and a secret ingredient. It is common to sight Shiva statues placed on lingas, and some idols that are missing a head on their shoulders either as a result of being at war with rival kingdoms or from being attached to precious jewels on crowns. Intricate details of Hindu mythology play out in the architecture, while their now-extinct script, which bears close resemblance to Sanskrit, is etched on stones. If this piques your interest, make a pit stop at the Cham Museum in Da Nang, which houses a huge collection of the dynasty’s carefully preserved relics found over 10 centuries. Da Nang Beach Bumming Of Vietnam’s 3,260-kilometre coastline, Da Nang occupies 35 kilometres stretching between Hai Van Pass and Non Nuoc. Base yourself near My Khe Beach and get rewarded with varying landscape views, where blue waters sit in juxtaposition with faraway mountains. Watch the sunrise from the shore, bring out the surfboards and catch the big waves, or grab a delicious banh mi from a nearby food stall and hang back until sunset—time moves at a snail’s place when there’s nowhere else you’d rather be. Make sure to also check out any of the plentiful eateries within walking distance. City of Bridges Predominantly a beach resort city, Da Nang is also famed for some of the country’s most iconic bridges. The 2,185 foot-long Dragon Bridge, opened only in 2013, frames the Han River and has quickly become a favourite among shutterbugs. Come weekends at 9 p.m., the “dragon” breathes fire and water, putting on a spectacular show that is best relished from the rooftop sky bar at Happy Yacht docked near Love Pier. It’d be a shame not to sneak a quick trip to Sun World’s Ba Na Hills, located half an hour west of the city. As you ascend 1,487 metres above sea level in the world’s longest non-stop, single-track cable car ride, at over 19,000 feet in length, swathes of the engulfing Truong Son Mountains come into view and the temperature suddenly plummets by a few degrees once you alight on the amusement park-cum-resort hill station. Be warned, its most famous attraction is also by far its most crowded; walk the 500-foot long Golden Bridge (aka the “Hand Bridge”)—a curving pedestrian bridge that appears to be held up over the world far below by two giant stone hands. The adjoining French Village enchants with a French Gothic-style cathedral, French restaurants, and cobblestoned streets, while an indoor amusement park is a field day for kids. While you’re there, polish off unlimited Vietnamese and European noshes at the two-storey buffet starting at only VND 2,50,000/₹850. Flavour Ferris Mi Quang, which literally translates to “Quang Noodles”, is a textural tour de force and a true taste of the province. The yellow-tinted flat rice noodles are perfumed with a bed of fresh vegetables and Vietnamese herbs, blended with a small but intense dose of pork or chicken stock. The dish is ubiquitously found on local menus. If it is sea-spread that you’re after, snap up a table at Brilliant Seafood, whose selection of live catch ranges between mantis shrimp, tiger prawn, crab, long-legged spiny lobster, Korean flounder and scallops, among others. Hue One for the Road The allure of a scenic route mustn’t be lost upon a road tripper in Vietnam. At the confluence of Da Nang in Quang Nam province and Lang Co in Thua Thien Hue province, lies the 21-kilometre stretch of Hai Van Pass. The mountain road snakes and climbs up to 500 metres above sea level and runs in tandem with the ocean and white sand strips of Lang Co village below. En route to the city of Hue, you’ll encounter open fields and the cloud-mirroring, 800-hectare brackish water of Lap An Lagoon—a sleepy fishing village and a popular spot for weekend getaways from Da Nang. The landscape needs to be seen to be believed. Hark Back to History For centuries, Hue prevailed as a political stronghold in the region and was also the seat of the Nguyen Dynasty between the 16th and the 20th centuries. Traces of its history are evident even today in moss-coated pagodas and Art Deco mansions with modernisation interjecting in the form of open parks, commercial markets, and traffic-devoid roads. The Imperial City of Hue must not be missed for its fortress and palace, the grandest of its kind in the country, spanning 10 kilometres in circumference. At Khai Dinh Tomb in Chau Chu mountain, one can see the resting place of Nguyen’s Dynasty’s 12th and last ruler—Emperor Khai Dinh (1885-1925). The complex—which took 11 years to build and was completed in 1931, six years after the king’s death—is modelled on the Chinese philosophy of feng shui, and is adorned with iron, steel, roof tiles, porcelain and collared glass from France, China, and Japan. A stop at the 19th-century Tu Duc tomb on Van Nien Hill provides an insight into Emperor Tu Duc’s life of imperial splendour, which he shared with his 104 wives and many concubines, although he fathered no children. The area is occupied by a pond, pavilions, chambers, courtyards, and a belying “tomb”, where the emperor and his treasures were supposedly buried. The real site is a well-guarded secret, and consequently, all 200 servants who buried Tu Duc were beheaded. The nearby Thuy Xuan incense village is a visual and olfactory overload. The scented incense sticks make for great souvenirs to bring back home. Dine like a King It is no secret that Hue was home to blue bloods, and now, its descendants. The region prides itself on mostly-vegetarian produce—devoured by aristocrats of yore—which featured in royal kitchens, and the traditional eventually made its way into many contemporary cafés. The family-run An Nhien Garden Vegetarian Restaurant & Cafe is a case in point and its ambiance is as refreshing as it is innovative. The garden setting is welcoming with al fresco seating and artworks sprawled on neatly manicured lawns. The indoor space is rather cosy and private. The real winner is the menu, which features only handmade ingredients with the exception of soy sauce. Dig into vegetable-stuffed rice sheet rolls dipped in peanut sauce—a house favourite appetiser—before moving on to the crunchy lotus seed rolls. The intricacy of sesame bamboo salad is topped by the simplicity of lotus seed rice, while chunks of cashews garnish the pineapple rice that comes undone in citrusy glory. But it is the violet rice cakes elevated with a generous drizzle of fish sauce that seals the deal. For a taste of nobility, try the king bean sweet soup, which was exclusively relished by noblemen in the past. The Language of the Lagoons Luckily, the region’s palate extends beyond the likes of all-vegetarian fare. Take a ferry ride across the brackish waters of Tam Giang Lagoon in Phong Dien in time for sunset. Fishermen will direct you to unassuming seafood restaurants built on stilts, where the menu takes a lagoon-to-table approach. Fish pancakes along with prawns, crabs, and scallops cultivated in the waters below are freshly cooked and served with a choice of condiments that will leave you licking your fingers clean. Reverie by the River There truly is no better way to kick start the day than by setting sail across the Huong River as it slices through the heart of Hue. The waterbody, monikered the Perfume River, flows through myriad forests, collecting sweet-scented orchids along the way in autumn before reaching the city. Watch the region slowly wake up in time for sunrise, but don’t be surprised if you see locals already having plunged in for a cold swim. Before Midnight In Hue, perks of after hours extend beyond the scope of a weekend. Head out to the main district and eat your way through Dong Ba Market before dropping in at Ta Vet Pub (or any of the adjoining bars) in the lively Vo Thi Sau Street for a cold beer that will set you back by VND 18,000/ ₹60. If you’re craving a kick of caffeine instead, sip on salt coffee—a Hue specialty—or the Hanoi invention of the creamy ca phe trung (egg coffee) that are just as sought after here. After all, Vietnam is the world’s largest coffee exporter second only to Brazil.\"]"
